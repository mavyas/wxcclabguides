# Introduction

## Lab Objective

- This lab is designed to ensure you are able to configure a voice contact end to end and receive it on the agent desktop.

- The lab will also contain multiple exercises on flow designer to make you comfortable with the Webex Contact Center Flow Designer and the overall Contact Routing configuration.

- **IVR Prompts:** We will expect you to configure and upload static prompts shared for use below. You may also choose to use dynamic TTS prompts, it will not change the lab or its content. You can upload these "CiscoDemo" prompts and use them for the labs. You may also keep a copy of the zip file if you want to manually upload them. In the bonus lab sections, we also share how you can convert these prompts to dynamic TTS prompts using the Text to speech connector configuration available within flow designer.

> ### [Download the IVR Prompts - Static Prompts HERE](https://cisco.box.com/s/e6dgudpc3zru5urm31gcnqfcbebx79b9){:target="\_blank"}

- **Lookups, Advanced Scripting, Screen-pops:** We have chosen specific areas of focus for advanced scripting topics. We have more content shared in the bonus sections on how to get other use cases configured.

- **GoTo, ScreenPops, Skills Based Routing:** We will cover the newer features on Webex Contact Center, including the GoTo step, Screen Pop, and skills based routing.

**Check Licenses**

### 1. Login to Control Hub > Users

- Ensure the agents have the contact center license selected and are properly configured as Contact center enabled on Webex Contact center.
- Ensure that they have activated the Email and are “Active” on Control Hub.

**Check Webex Calling Settings**

### 2. Verify Webex Calling Settings

- Check that a "Main" number is assigned to Webex Calling.
- Check that the Calling Location is correctly set to "Intelepeer"

**Synchronize Users**

### 3. Synchronize users to get any newly activated users.

- Got to Contact Center > Settings > Synchronize Users

**Check Admin settings, Agent Settings, Site, Team Configuration**

### 4. Launch Portal to ensure the admin user admin1pod**@** is Contact center configured for testing.

- Ensure that a Site and a Team has been created: `Site_TS`, `Team_TS`
- Ensure the user is Contact Center Enabled.
- Associate the User to the Site, Team, ( `Site_TS`, `Team_TS`) and default Multimedia Profile - `Default_Telephony_Profile`.
- Verify by Launching the Agent Desktop and logging in.

Desktop URL: **https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/**

> **Note:** Please Check the `Site_TS` that the user admin1pod__@email.carehybrid.com is assigned to. And create the `Team_TS` under the right Site.

- If you would like to Create a Team, create the Team under that Site - and assign the Team to the Agent.
- `Agent` > `Site` relationship cannot be changed. So all teams will need to be created under the same site.
- With the steps outlined in the previous lab and recap above, you should now be able to login to the agent desktop.

> Only teams that are in the same site of the Agent will be visible to assign to the agent.

### 5. OPTIONAL: Verify Webex Calling PC App Installation

> **Lab Participants can download and install the WebEx Calling App for Agents, Admins or Supervisors and make on-net calls in the US.**

**[Webex Calling PC APP - Download HERE !](https://cisco.app.box.com/s/fcbh0abcsruf5qxp99tj31ksx1bf2mh5){:target="\_blank"}**

> Desktop: **[https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com](https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com){:target="\_blank"}**\

## Steps

### 1. Copy out the flow and configure the advanced flow

- Open the Portal > Routing Strategy > Flow page.
- Copy the existing flow `Flow1` and edit the copied flow - name it `Flow2`
- Edit the flow to go into flow designer.
- Ensure that you configure the Menu steps with a 3 options - 2 queue, 1 Blind Transfer.
- Ensure you configure all the fields in the menu step including the prompts and the entry timeout (requires you to explore all options on the step).
- Ensure you configure all the blind transfer location to Cisco Toll Free : `+18005536387`

  > **Note: This will actually connect you to the live toll free number!**

> **Important TIP on the MENU Block**

> `Make all Menu Steps Interruptible by default` - This gives callers an option to bypass the prompt. It is a small checkbox on the Menu Step.

> `In the Menu Block > Advanced Settings > Entry Timeout = Make it 10 Seconds` - This gives callers enough time to complete the DTMF (digit) entry.

---

### 3. Configure the Queue Treatment loop and Opt Out and Callback steps

- In Flow Designer - Configure the Queue treatment for the first queue. Use the queueCounter variable and configure the Opt out steps including the high volume message and the callback step.
- Configure the voicemail destination to the same external number above.
- Validate the flow and publish it.

### 4. Plug In New Flow into Routing Strategy

- Go to the routing Strategy page > Routing Strategy > `EP_TS`
- Once the flow is published, configure the Entry Point Routing strategy to point to the new flow `Flow2`

### 5. Test the end to end flow

- Login to the agent desktop and go Idle (Not Ready)
- Test Queue treatment by going not ready on the agent desktop.
- Call the main number on the entry point and go into the queue. You should hear the queue twice and then have an option to leave a callback.
- leave the callback and the call should end.

### 6. Execute the Callback

- Have the agent go ready after you left a callback.
- They should receive the callback call.

# Part 4: Advanced Scripting Steps - HTTP Request

<iframe width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gXhVTkGazmk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Quick Links**

> Control hub: **[https://admin.webex.com](https://admin.webex.com){:target="\_blank"}**\

> Portal: **[https://portal.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/portal](https://portal.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/portal){:target="\_blank"}**\

> Desktop: **[https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com](https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com){:target="\_blank"}**\

## Steps

### 1. Copy out the flow and configure the advanced flow 2

- Open the Portal > Routing Strategy > Flow page.
- Copy the existing flow `Flow2` and edit the copied flow - name it `Flow3`
- Edit the flow to go into flow designer.

### 2. Enhance the existing flow with an authentication piece

- Drag a play message block, Collect Digits, HTTP Request, Condition Block, 2 more Play message blocks and put them in front of the menu step.
- Ensure the prompts are plugged in to the play message prompts. `welcome`, `enter_pin`, and after the HTTP and Condition, a corresponding success and failure prompt.

> **Important TIP on the MENU Block**

> `Make all Menu Steps Interruptible by default` - This gives callers an option to bypass the prompt. It is a small checkbox on the Menu Step.

> `In the Menu Block > Advanced Settings > Entry Timeout = Make it 10 Seconds` - This gives callers enough time to complete the DTMF (digit) entry.

### 3. Configure the Collect Digits block

- Configure the Collect Digits Block to a 5 digits max/min and ensure the timeouts are properly setup.

### 4. Configure the custom variables and the HTTP Request Block

- Create 4 Custom variables - mark them CAD variables - with names `name`,`email`,`phone`, `account` with labels `Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Account` and values of `None` OR `null` - _(depends on what you prefer as the default for the agents to see if no info is available in the data dip)_

> The actual request we will construct is :

**HTTPS GET -> https://5f97898842706e0016957443.mockapi.io/crm/api/customers?pin=18716**

- Use the variable from the CollectDigits1.EnteredPIN variable to inject it in the pin lookup.
- We will construct it as follows

```
HTTP Request
GET https://5f97898842706e0016957443.mockapi.io/crm/api/customers

Query    <->     Parameters
pin      <->     {{CollectDigits.DigitsEntered}}

with value of the block (recheck your block variable name!)

The type would be application/json

The Parse settings would be :
customerName = $.[0].name
customerEmail = $.[0].email
customerPhone = $.[0].phone
```

**Tech-Tip:** Here are some practice exercises you can try by going to jsonpath.com

> - Go to https://5f97898842706e0016957443.mockapi.io/crm/api/customers

> - Copy out the JSON into https://jsonpath.com on the left pane.

> - Try out all of these to learn how JSON path works!

| Query For                                                     | Parse statement                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| All Customers                                                 | `$.*`                                 |
| First Customer                                                | `$.[0]`                               |
| Last Customer                                                 | `$.[-1:]`                             |
| First two customers                                           | `$.[0:2]`                             |
| Last two customers                                            | `$.[-2:]`                             |
| Second from last                                              | `$.[-2:-1]`                           |
| All the names                                                 | `$..name`                             |
| All the pins                                                  | `$..pin`                              |
| All the customers who’s pin value is more than 70000 or 80000 | `$..[?(@.pin > 70000)]`               |
| All details of customer with account number                   | `$..[?(@.account == "87305901”)].*`   |
| Name of customer with account number                          | `$.[?(@.account == "70579265")].name` |

### 5. Configure the Conditional for Error Check

- Use the httpBlock.StatusCode variable to check the value retured.
- Note that the test API does not give a 404 but an empty list [] with a 200 when no match is found. However, this step is just to understand error handling and checking.
- Use the `</>` expression check on the condition and play success and failure prompts accordingly.
- Ensure all the settings per block are entered and properly setup.
- Validate and Publish the new script, correcting any errors that show up during validation.

### 6. Point to the New flow in the Routing Strategy

- Go to the routing Strategy page > Routing Strategy > `EP_TS`
- Once the flow is published, configure the Entry Point Routing strategy to point to the new flow `Flow3`.

### 7. Verify the flow end to end

- Verify the new flow end to end by first, logging into the Agent Desktop and going into a ready state.

Execute the Test:

- Call the Dial number > Enter the 5 digit PIN number as `18716` > On Main Menu press 2 > call gets connected to agent,

`Agent should see all CAD variables (Customer Name, Email, Account Number)`
